/* module specific MISRA deviations:

   MD_DEM_1.1_612
     Description: Rule 1.1
                  All code shall conform to ISO 9899:1990 C programming language, ISO 9899, amended and corrected by
                  ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1995, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and ISO/IEC 9899/COR2: 1996
     Reason:      Depending on the configuration size the generated tables can
                  exceed the C90 limit of 32767 bytes
     Risk:        Compilation error.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility must be tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_5.1
     Description: Rule 5.1
                  Identifiers (internal and external) shall not rely on the significance of more than 31 characters.
     Reason:      The API is standardized and a change would break compliance.
     Risk:        Compilation errors are possible.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility is tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_8.5:
     Description: Rule 8.5
                  There shall be no definitions of objects or functions in a header file.
     Reason:      Subcomponent structure is implemented in header files. The implementation files can be identified by
                  their name ending in _Implementation.h
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.7:
     Description: Rule 8.7
                  Objects shall be defined at block scope if they are only accessed from within a single function.
     Reason:      Vector style guide prevents usage of static variables in function scope
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.8_dcm:
     Description: Rule 8.8
                  An external object or function shall be declared in one and only one file.
     Reason:      MICROSAR Dcm generates all prototypes of functions used. This leads to duplicate definitions.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_11.1:
     Decription:  Rule 11.1
                  Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any type other than an integral type.
     Reason:      Different types of callback functions need to be supported through a generic mechanism
     Risk:        Functions are cast to the wrong type before calling.
     Prevention:  The correct function type is indicated by type tagging. The correct cast is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_11.4_cpy:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of memcopy/memset requires common pointer type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_inh:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of inheritance pattern requires cast to specific class type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_nvm:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Mechanism for Nv handling requires common pointer type
     Risk:        None. Pointers are initially aligned and only cast due to common API later on.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_sr:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Serialization of typed data.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.5:
     Description: Rule 11.5
                  A cast shall not be performed that removes any const or volatile qualification from the type
                  addressed by a pointer.
     Reason:      MemSet and MemCpy are defined as taking an unqualified pointer.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  Safe access of shared data is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_12.4_cs:
     Description: Rule 12.4
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain side effects
     Reason:      The function must be called in a critical section, so the access to volatile variables does not
                  apply as side effect.
     Risk:        Additional calls might be introduces later outside the critical section.
     Prevention:  Requirement for critical section is documented and compliance is assured during code review.

   MD_DEM_12.4_cf:
     Description: Rule 12.4
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain side effects
     Reason:      The function called on the right hand side has no side effects.
     Risk:        The function may introduce side effects at a later time.
     Prevention:  Code analysis (e.g. MISRA).

   MD_DEM_12.4_m:
     Description: Rule 12.4
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain side effects
     Reason:      The right hand operand may only be evaluated if the left hand operator is valid. This is more
                  maintainable than introducing additional levels of nesting, since nesting does reduce readibility
                  and does not reduce the risk of missing the order dependency of the two terms.
     Risk:        Later rework might miss the dependency and turn the order of checks around.
     Prevention:  Code analysis (e.g. MISRA) and review.

   MD_DEM_13.3:
     Description: Rule 13.3
                  Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality.
     Reason:      Test for generatad special value.
     Risk:        None
     Prevention:  Correctness is ensured in test suite.

   MD_DEM_13.6:
     Description: Rule 13.6
                  Numeric variables being used within a for loop for iteration counting shall not be modified in the
                  body of the loop.
     Reason:      Restore loop invariant in an error case.
     Risk:        Difficult to maintain.
     Prevention:  Correctness is ensured in test suite.

   MD_DEM_13.7:
     Description: Rule 13.7
                  Boolean operations whose results are invariant shall not be permitted.
     Reason:      The expression is not invariant. Depending on supported features invariant value is possible but
                  the resulting code modification will adversely affect maintainability of already complicated code
                  paths.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1_ACCESSOR
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  Static function '%s()' is not used within this translation unit.
     Reason:      Accessor function ('getter', 'setter') is present although no code is actively using it.
                  Accessor functions do not provide functionality, and are not conditionally compiled to increase
                  maintainability.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings depending on configuration.
                  No reduced code size with a special configuration, not realized optimization.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1:
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  This switch default label is unreachable.
     Reason:      Switch default labels are mandatory due to mandatory MISRA rule 15.3 'The final clause of a switch
                  statement shall be the default clause.'.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
                  Default branch cannot be tested.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.2:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  All non-null statements shall either (i) have at least one side-effect however executed, or
                  (ii) cause control flow to change
     Reason:      This statement is used to avoid warnings caused by unused parameters. Parameters are defined by
                  standardized API requirements, and not needed in case a feature is disabled by configuration.
                  It is either impossible due to API standardization or necessary code duplication (severe maintenance
                  increase) to provide feature dependent APIs with different signatures.
     Risk:        Unavoidable compiler warning or error because of either unused statements or unused parameter.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.5:
     Description: Rule 14.5
                  The continue statement shall not be used
     Reason:      The continue statement is used in a circumstance where a different approach would reduce efficiency
                  or maintainability due to increased complexity.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.6_err:
     Description: Rule 14.6
                  For any iteration statement there shall be at most one break statement used for loop termination.
     Reason:      The loop needs multiple exit points since error conditions cannot be verified prior to the loop.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.6_opt:
     Description: Rule 14.6
                  For any iteration statement there shall be at most one break statement used for loop termination.
     Reason:      Increased efficiency on the time critical path
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  The break statement is documented.

   MD_DEM_14.7:
     Description: Rule 14.7
                  A function shall have a single point of exit at the end of the function.
     Reason:      Due to maintainability problems the control flow through the function shall not be complicated even
                  further.
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_15.2:
     Description: Rule 15.2
                  An unconditional break statement shall terminate every non-empty switch clause.
     Reason:      The fall-through is preferred to an if-else cascade to avoid code duplication in this particular
                  circumstance.
     Risk:        Adverse effect on maintainability.
     Prevention:  The fall-through is documented.

   MD_DEM_16.4_dcm:
     Description: Rule 16.4
                  The identifiers used in the declaration and definition of a function shall be identical
     Reason:      Dcm generates its own prototypes based on a generic algorithm.
     Risk:        Dcm prototypes can deviate from the implementation.
     Prevention:  Verify compatibility during integraton tests.

   MD_DEM_16.4_rte:
     Description: Rule 16.4
                  The identifiers used in the declaration and definition of a function shall be identical
     Reason:      Port-Defined arguments are not generated with the correct name. This can currently not be influenced
                  due to the RTE being a third party module.
     Risk:        None. The generated prototypes are never used directly but only from generated RTE code.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The API is standardized and a change would break compliance.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_False:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The data behind the pointer is modified, or modified in some configurations. This is a false positive.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_Internal:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The API has to be compatible to a common prototype
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_Design:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The function has write access to shared state. The caller may not rely on constancy. Even if the
                  current implementation does not need write access, this is allowed to change. A stable interface is
                  preferred to adhering to this rule.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.9_fp:
     Description: Rule 16.9
                  A function identifier shall only be used with either a preceding &, or with a parenthesised parameter
                  list, which may be empty.
     Reason:      There is a preceeding &, and the use as a function pointer is intended

                  receive a pointer to an iterator variable Dem_Cfg_<X>IterType.
                  The Dem_Cfg_<X>IterInit initializes the iterator variable, so it is valid to be used by the other three functions.
                  Those functions expect a reference to a valid iterator variable. The iterator variable is still valid
                  when those functions return.
                  Not all call paths initialize the iterator.
  \COUNTERMEASURE \N The iterator in this case is a global variable, as such the iterator pointer is always valid.
                  No other function accesses the same global variable (it could be function scope static but this is
                  not allowed due to coding guidelines).
                  As such it is not modified outside the function and it can be assumed that the iterator state remains valid in
                  between function calls.
                  Missing initialization cannot cause memory corruption.
